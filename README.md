#Slack Archive Stats

This package will traverse a directory of Slack archive files and produce a set of interesting - random? - statistics about its use. If I do this right, I'll make it easy to extend so you can write new adapters for new stats you're interested in. Chances are, I won't do it right the first time though. :)

##Getting Started
Assuming you've downloaded and extracted the Slack archive somewhere already and cloned this repo. 

    > npm install
    > node start <root-directory-of-archive>
